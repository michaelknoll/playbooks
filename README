## Managing TYPO3 Users

### Setting up a Test Environment with Vagrant

Running the following commands, you get a Vagrant sandbox (running on IP 10.20.30.100) to test the Playbooks for user management:

    vagrant up
    # when asked for password, use 'ansible'
    ssh-copy-id ansible@10.20.30.100

### Update email address for typo3.org user

Use the following ansible command to update the users on the servers configured in `hosts`:

    ansible-playbook -u <your username> -i hosts playbooks/t3org_email.yaml

In the *Vagrant* environment, you can use

    ansible-playbook -u ansible -i hosts playbooks/t3org_email.yaml
